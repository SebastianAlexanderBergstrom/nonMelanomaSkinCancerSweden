# nonMelanomaSkinCancerSweden
Hobby project for modeling non melanoma skin cancer in Sweden and examining how important the one-standard-error-rule is for variable selection done via cross-validation.

The goal of this project was to see how important the one-standard-error rule mentioned in Introduction to Statistical Learning was when performing
variable selection using cross-validation. The code files also include data formatting and some visual analysis of the data. The results are presented
in blog posts, see link below.
